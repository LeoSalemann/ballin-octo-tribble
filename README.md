My sandbox repo for playing with git on LAN vs github online

This line was added via github.com over the web (safari). It was done right after this repo was created.

Here is a line I added from the IE10 - Win7_1 Clone, pushing to a shared network drive.

Here is a line I added from IE10 Win7_1, pushing to its (local) shared nework drive.

Here's a change I made when I was totally cut off from all networks. I only did a commit, not a push.

A second off-network commit. Will it show up as a single-line diff?

Now I'm going to get back online and push, then commit.

Back offline again.  The prevous three lines were done with TortoiseGIT, now we'll try purple kitty-cat.

Still offline, trying for two commits, which will bump the Sync up to 2; then one big push.
